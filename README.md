 ðŸŒ± #Plant Nursery Simulator

A C++ object-oriented simulation of a plant nursery that models the complexities of greenhouse management, staff coordination, and customer interactions. Built as part of the COS 214 Final Project (University of Pretoria), the system demonstrates how design patterns bring structure, flexibility, and scalability to software design.

##The Plant Nursery Simulator captures the dynamic environment of a nursery:

* Greenhouse & Garden Area â€“ where plants grow, follow life cycles, and require different care strategies.

* Staff â€“ responsible for plant care, managing inventory, and assisting customers.

* Customers & Sales Floor â€“ customers browse plants, ask for recommendations, and place customised orders.
